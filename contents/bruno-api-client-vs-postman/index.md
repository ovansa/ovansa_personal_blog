### Introduction

Before now, I leaned heavily on **Postman** for my API exploratory tests and basic API automation workflows. For the most part, Postman served me well - its GUI interface made it easy to interact with endpoints, write scripts, and quickly validate functionality during manual and regression testing.

**For context**, exploratory testing - in the context of APIs - involves interacting with endpoints while simultaneously learning about system behavior, designing tests, and spotting issues. It often happens before writing automated checklists or deeper tests, and plays a critical role in understanding a product‚Äôs quality and reliability.

While Postman has been the go-to **API testing tool** for many QA engineers and developers, I started exploring alternatives that would better align with how I like to version control tests and run them via the CLI. That‚Äôs when I found **Bruno**, a powerful, developer-friendly alternative to Postman for API testing.

### Why Look Beyond Postman?

Postman is feature-rich, but I hit some limitations during my day-to-day testing process:

- **Exporting tests:** After writing test scripts, I had to export the collection as JSON before running via Newman (Postman‚Äôs CLI runner).
- **Limited CLI execution flexibility:** You can‚Äôt run a single request with Newman - only entire folders or collections.
- **Cloud-first collaboration model:** Working offline meant losing key features like syncing, comments, and shared environments unless exported.
- **Test scripts and pre-request scripts are bundled:** Postman mixes both in a single tab, which can get messy for large test suites.

These limitations prompted me to look for a tool that treated API test automation like code - something local-first, file-based, and CI/CD-friendly. That‚Äôs where **Bruno API Client** stood out.

### Getting Started with Bruno for API Testing

Unlike Postman, **Bruno is a Git-friendly, open-source API client** with a developer-centric philosophy. Each request is saved as a `.bru` file inside a local folder - perfect for versioning with Git and collaborating via pull requests.

Here are a few reasons why Bruno shines for exploratory and automated API testing:

- ‚úÖ **File-based structure:** You can manage collections like source code - no need to export JSON.
- ‚úÖ **Clean separation of scripts:** Test logic is placed inside a dedicated "Tests" tab, unlike Postman which mixes pre-request and test code.
- ‚úÖ **Built-in test libraries:** Bruno supports `axios` and `chai` for scripting and assertions - no external setup needed.
- ‚úÖ **Powerful CLI:** Run collections, folders, or single `.bru` requests - giving you granular control over test execution.

Here‚Äôs how you can run Bruno requests from the terminal:

Run an entire collection:

```bash
bru run ./ -r --env "Todo App" --output test-results.html --format html

Run a folder:

bru run ./auth -r --env "Todo App" --output auth-results.html --format html

Run a single request:

bru run ./auth/login.bru -r --env "Todo App"

This is especially useful for integrating Bruno API tests in CI/CD pipelines, offering an alternative to Newman but with more flexibility.

Bruno vs Postman: Key Differences for Test Automation

Feature	Postman	Bruno
File-based storage	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes
Offline-first	‚ö†Ô∏è Limited	‚úÖ Fully
Git-friendly	‚ùå Manual exports	‚úÖ Native
CLI single request execution	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes
Built-in test libraries (chai, axios)	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes
Test & pre-request script separation	‚ùå Combined	‚úÖ Separate
UI experience	‚úÖ Polished	‚úÖ Lightweight
Open source	‚ùå No	‚úÖ Yes

If you‚Äôre familiar with tools like Cypress, Playwright, or Jest, Bruno‚Äôs CLI-first, code-as-test structure will feel right at home.

Migration from Postman to Bruno

If you already have collections and scripts in Postman, Bruno offers a smooth import feature. It automatically converts your Postman collection and its associated test scripts into Bruno‚Äôs folder and .bru file format - with minimal tweaking required. You won‚Äôt lose your test logic, and you‚Äôll gain the benefits of Git versioning and local control.

This makes Bruno ideal for teams transitioning from cloud-first API testing tools to a more open-source, developer-friendly API test automation setup.

Final Thoughts

This isn‚Äôt about replacing Postman - it‚Äôs about choosing the right tool for your workflow.
	‚Ä¢	Choose Postman if you value a collaborative GUI, integrated cloud syncing, and a large ecosystem.
	‚Ä¢	Choose Bruno if you want a fast, local-first API testing tool that fits naturally into developer workflows and version control.

If you want to see how a real-world test automation setup looks in both tools, I‚Äôve created two public repositories for comparison:
	‚Ä¢	üîß Bruno Setup: https://github.com/ovansa/todo-api-test-bruno
	‚Ä¢	üì¶ Postman Setup: https://github.com/ovansa/todo-api-test-postman

Try cloning either and running the tests locally to feel the difference.
