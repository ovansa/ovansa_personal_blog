# The Tale of Missing Requirements: When MVP Meets Reality

## The Challenge

I recently worked on a remittance API project where, like many new initiatives, we set out to build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with planned future improvements. As the tester, I found myself dealing with a common problem: balancing minimal requirements against proper software testing.

Despite having initial user stories and acceptance criteria, our team kept adjusting workflows during development. The "minimum" in MVP kept changing as we moved forward.

## The Moment of Truth

As we got closer to completion and began seeking approvals (which are very strict for financial products), the business team started their review. Their questions were basic but important:

"What if a user wants to move money from different forms to another, does it do it properly?"
"How does the system handle failed transfers?"
"What records are kept for tracking purposes?"

These weren't small detailsâ€”they were basic parts of a money transfer product. Yet I couldn't answer many of these questions with confidence. Not because I missed them in testing, but because they simply weren't included in our MVP scope.

## Bridging the Gap

The job to find answers fell to me. This meant I needed to figure out:

- What the business team expected
- What we actually built
- What needed to be added to close these gaps

After digging into the codebase, my test documentation, and the questions raised, I made a list of missing items. When I shared these gaps with the development team, I was met with uncertain looks. No one had clear answers because these items had been put off as "post-MVP improvements."

## Root Causes

How did we end up here? Several things contributed:

1. **MVP Thinking**: The focus on building just the basics created a kind of tunnel vision. Both testers and developers looked only at immediate needs rather than understanding how the MVP fit into the bigger picture.

2. **Changing Leadership**: Our product and project managers weren't always available. Both roles eventually passed to new team members who didn't know the history of the product decisions.

3. **Incomplete Documentation**: While we had user stories, we didn't have good documentation about business rules and how the MVP would grow into the full product.

## Lessons for Testers

This experience taught me valuable lessons about testing in MVP projects:

- **Look Beyond Requirements**: Your job as a tester is to find anything that would make the product less valuable to users and business teams, even if it's not in the written requirements.

- **Question What "Minimum" Means**: Sometimes what's considered an "extra feature" is actually necessary functionality.

- **Write Down Assumptions**: When requirements keep changing, document what you're assuming during testing and share it early.

- **Keep a List of Risks**: Maintain a list of potential problems and gaps, even those beyond what you're currently building.

- **Don't Let Issues Drop**: When you find missing requirements, keep following up until there's a clear answer.

## Moving Forward

The MVP approach doesn't free the testing team from understanding the complete product vision, it actually makes that understanding more important. Looking back, we should have spent more time at the start mapping out the entire user journey, even if we were only building part of it to begin with.

By keeping an eye on both what we're delivering now and the end goal, testers can help make sure that "minimum viable" doesn't become "barely useful."

What has worked for you when testing MVP products? I'd like to hear about it.
