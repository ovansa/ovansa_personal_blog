## Introduction

In the world of modern web development, APIs are the glue that connects frontend and backend systems. Postman is one of the most popular tools for testing and developing APIs, offering a powerful, user-friendly interface for making HTTP requests and managing test suites.

This guide walks you through everything you need to know to start using Postman effectively.

---

## What is Postman?

Postman is an API client that allows you to create, test, and manage HTTP requests. It supports all standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and more.

### Key Features

- Easy-to-use UI for making requests
- Collection management
- Environment variables
- Automated testing with scripts
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

---

## Installation

Download Postman from the [official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Itâ€™s available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## Making Your First Request

1. Open Postman and click `+` to create a new tab.
2. Set the method to `GET`.
3. Enter a sample URL like `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`.
4. Click `Send`.

You should receive a JSON response with post data.

---

## Using Collections

Collections are folders that help you group related requests.

### Create a Collection

1. Click `Collections` in the sidebar.
2. Click `New Collection`.
3. Add a request to it and give it a name.

---

## Environments and Variables

Environments allow you to store variables like `baseUrl`, `apiKey`, or `userId`.

### Steps:

1. Go to the `Environments` tab and create a new one.
2. Add a variable `baseUrl` with value like `https://api.example.com`.
3. Use `{{baseUrl}}` in your requests.

---

## Writing Tests in Postman

You can write test scripts in JavaScript using the `Tests` tab.

```js
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
  pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response time is less than 500ms", function () {
  pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(500);
});
```

---

## Running Tests with Collection Runner

1. Click the **Runner** button (top left).
2. Choose your collection and environment.
3. Run the tests and view results in real-time.

---

## Automating with Newman

[Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) is Postmanâ€™s command-line tool.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g newman
```

### Run a Collection

```bash
newman run ./my-collection.json -e ./my-environment.json
```

Perfect for CI/CD pipelines!

## Conclusion

Postman is an essential tool for developers and QA engineers alike. With features like collections, environments, scripting, and automation, it helps you streamline your API workflow.

Mastering Postman will significantly boost your productivity when building and testing APIs.
